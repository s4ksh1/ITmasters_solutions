Graphics files might not seem to contain information related to your investigation.  However, information can be hidden inside an image 
by using a data-hiding technique called steganography which uses a host file to cover the contents of a secret message.

In this project, you will use S-Tools4 to reveal hidden text from an image.  
Download S-Tools4 from http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/21688/s-tools4.zip.html.

You are provided an image file Project3.bmp. This image file contains hidden text. You are required to reveal the hidden text.
